Created a complex password manager using AWS to host MongoDB NoSQL Database.\
Using AWS created an EC2 instance to host a NoSQL database that stored usernames, services, and hashed passwords using the SHA256 algorithm.\
Generated seed phrases using entropy, checksum and BIP39 wordlist.

- Uuid - A method to identify each user
- Fernet & Hashlib - Encrypt and hash passwords to then store them in the db
- Pytest - How unit tests work

Also learnead new techonologies such as: MongoDB, SHA256 algorithm & BIP39 wordlist

## To-Do
- [ ]  100% code coverage
